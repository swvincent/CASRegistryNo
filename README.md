# CAS Registry Utility

CAS Registry Numbers (CAS Numbers) are unique numerical identifiers assigned to chemical substances. They are managed by the [Chemical Abstracts Service](https://www.cas.org/).

An example is 58-08-2, which is the CAS Number for Caffeine.

This project contains a class to validate CAS Numbers by ensuring they're in the correct format and that they contains a valid check digit.
